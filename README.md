# Neighbourhood map - Udacity Frontend nanodegree project

This is a single-page application featuring a map of my city (Cluj-Napoca, Rom√¢nia). 
- It includes a dropdown menu that filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input or selection. 
- A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied.
Clicking a location on the list displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker (e.g. bouncing, color change.)
List functionality is responsive and runs error free.

Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.

Clicking a marker displays unique information about a location in an infoWindow.
